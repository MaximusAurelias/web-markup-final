             Before we put the spotlight on this neighbourhood, it is critical to know where this town is found. <em>Scheveningen </em>is situated in the Netherlands. 
             The country currently known as the Netherlands has been inhabited for millennia. 
             Celtic and Germanic clans were some of the first inhabitants. 
             The Romans momentarily controlled pieces of the region during the first century BC, yet the region was for the most part outside the Roman Realm.
              During the Medieval times, the area saw the growth of different trading towns. The Dutch cities turned out to be financially strong through trade. 
              The 17th century, also known as The Dutch Golden Age, was a time of economic prosperity. 
              The Dutch East Indian Company and West Indian Company had significant roles in global exchange of goods.

            After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands was established by the Congress of Vienna. 
            The United Kingdom of the Netherlands also included Belgium. 
            <aside> Belgium later became independent.</aside>
            <p> As the country moves forward to the 19th century, the great rise of industrialization is seen through the building of modern infrastructure.
                This included canals and railways. Within this time period, the Netherlands was also occupied by Nazi Germany. The war caused great turmoil and hardship on the population. 
   
               On April 4 1949, the Netherlands became a founding Member of NATO. After the war, the government started reconstruction and focusing on economic growth. 
               To prohibit the Netherlands from being vulnerable to another World War, a military allegiance was created. 
               This allegiance consisted of 12 countries in Europe and North America. The goal of this allegiance was to provide military support to each other when necessary.
                Two years later, The European Coal and Steel Community (a predecessor to the European Union) was also established.</p>
            
            
            Today, the Netherlands is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system and a strong tradition of liberal democracy. 
            It is renowned for its flat landscape, extensive canal systems, tulip fields, windmills, and vibrant cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam. 
            The Dutch are known for their contributions to art, science, and trade, making the country a fascinating blend of history and modernity.

                Scheveningen started out as a little fishing village. 
                Fishing was the main source of food and income.  Earliest inhabitants go as far back as 1280. 
                After storms continually destroyed a lot of the houses between 1400-1894, the villagers decided to build a harbour. Once the harbour had been built, more modern ships became popular.
